553.88

655.56
662.76
"Okay in the dormitory no boys could come upstairs they could only meet you downstairs in the reception area"
662.76
674.2
"So you had a buzzer and they would buzz your room and tell you that such and such was down for you in the lobby so you would have to walk down and receive them there and if you went off fine"

786.04
787.48
"Part time full time"
787.48
796.08
"I was full time because I had been a teacher for two years and I came back that third year"
796.08
818.96
"Deciding that I needed more to teach the students that I had because in English education we’ve been given an approach to teaching that worked very well with bright students but more and more special needs students were emerging and I felt like I need something else"
818.96
819.8
"Let me back up here"
819.8
825.12

"You know analyzing poems a lot of analytical kind of thing and composition through analysis of character themes and it’s what you’re still doing in schools"
854.44
873.2
"But there are different strata of kids that had needs that were different from that and I said okay what can I do to empower myself to gain additional skills to reach these students who are not there but who were showing up in my class every day"
873.2
877.52
"And so I got the idea to go back get a degree in special education"
877.52
881.92
"And so that’s what I received my masters in"
881.92
885.28
"And so I don’t really know what the setting was"
885.28
887.16
"So you weren’t involved in the black student union"
887.16
888.6
"No not at that point"

894.88
913.6
"Let’s back up a little bit you were talking about your parents and they hadn’t even graduate from high school so if I can ask you to go back a little bit and talk about your home life or early schooling so that’s a huge decision to be the first first family member to go to college"

"Right right"
914.0
915.0

956.88
"And my pop came back from the war and you know they fell in love and they got married"
956.88
975.36
"And so when he came from the war he wanted a trade that was the big thing in black families for the men to get trades because they being a brick mason or a carpenter and all that paid some pretty good money"
975.36
987.88
"So my father went to Bethune Cookman College trade school on the GI bill so he became a brick mason and later a subcontractor"
987.88
993.08
"So for 38 years he built houses"
993.08
1005.72
"But my mom worked for a prominent white family in town keeping their house and their children"
1005.72
1009.72

1028.64
1034.24
"You know I’ve always been highly motivated for education"
1034.24
1041.28
"And I excelled coming through the different grades and it just seemed like the normal progression for me"

1051.68
1057.84
"No the teachers didn’t say anything to me personal"
1057.84
1068.28
"It was just they taught their course you know they didn’t say anything good or bad just taught the content"
1068.28
1081.68
"And so my reinforcement pretty much came from my family and my teachers through the years always told me I was special always told me I was smart"
1081.68
1101.52
"I was an honors student honor society I was in the campus leadership was a part of the band as one of those little flag girls sort of things kind of a half majorette half flag girl"

1134.12
"At first I was thinking of going to Dillard in New Orleans which is a black school"

"Purely because I wanted to go to Mardi Gras"
1140.48
1142.56
"You mentioned the partying"
1142.56
1147.56
"But my parents didn’t know I don’t think so"
1147.56
1148.08
"Why not"
1148.08
1151.16
"Well they that’s too far away we don’t have the money to support you in that"
1151.16
1154.44
"We can’t you know bring you home for the holidays"
1154.44
1159.68
"It’s too far for us to send you know if there’s an emergency or whatever"
1159.68
1172.52
"We think it’s better if you go to junior college and then you go to junior college and you can go to one of the state schools and that will be better for you and for us"
1172.52
1176.2
"So you know after really putting up a big fuss I lost"
